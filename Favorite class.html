        <p1> One of my favorite classes I have taken at the University of Maine so far is BUA 235. We have done a lot of really cool stuff with coding and technology and I feel that everything that I have learned will help me in the future.

         	One thing that I had a lot of fun doing was Homework assignment 2 when we created a dashboard on Excel. This is what mine looked like when I was all finished!
